   We are international students presently residing and attending university in Canada. When we first arrived, we talked about how we were both surprised by the housing and rent prices because, compared to our home countries, they were not only unreasonably high, but you had to overpay for what you were getting. This was true not just in the metropolitan area but also in Canada's more remote regions. Finding an affordable location where we can live and feel comfortable is crucial because we both depend on renting, which accounts for a significant percentage of our monthly expenses. We chose to analyse this data set because it is a great opportunity to learn more about Canada's housing and rental markets, comprehend the variables that influence rent and home prices, and identify any other correlations that might exist within particular regions. Additionally, this analysis may one day be helpful for other international and domestic students who are paying rent in Canada or for people seeking to buy their first home.
