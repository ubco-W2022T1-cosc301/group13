## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

   We are international students presently residing and attending university in Canada. When we first arrived, we talked about how we were both surprised by the housing and rent prices because, compared to our home countries, they were not only unreasonably high, but you had to overpay for what you were getting. This was true not just in the metropolitan area but also in Canada's more remote regions. Finding an affordable location where we can live and feel comfortable is crucial because we both depend on renting, which accounts for a significant percentage of our monthly expenses. We chose to analyse this data set because it is a great opportunity to learn more about Canada's housing and rental markets, comprehend the variables that influence rent and home prices, and identify any other correlations that might exist within particular regions. Additionally, this analysis may one day be helpful for other international and domestic students who are paying rent in Canada or for people seeking to buy their first home.

This data was provided by [Statcan](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=1810020501) and contains information on the new housing price index on a monthly basis. The dataset also contains files on other supporting information like Income and Population distribution, inflation rates, and more. The dataset contains data from 1982 to 2022, and is stored as public information on the official Statcan website. We plan to use the primary files to gather context on the housing prices and rent, and understand how they have changed in the past few years. We plan to use the supporting files to try and understand the different factors that influence the pricing of the housing market. This data was gathered by surveying builders' selling prices of new residential homes and it also contains estimates entered by the sellers themselves for further context.
