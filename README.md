## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data was provided by [Statcan](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=1810020501) and contains information on the new housing price index on a monthly basis. The dataset also contains files on other supporting information like Income and Population distribution, inflation rates, and more. The dataset contains data from 1982 to 2022, and is stored as public information on the official Statcan website. We plan to use the primary files to gather context on the housing prices and rent, and understand how they have changed in the past few years. We plan to use the supporting files to try and understand the different factors that influence the pricing of the housing market. This data was gathered by surveying builders' selling prices of new residential homes and it also contains estimates entered by the sellers themselves for further context.
